Assignment I - Interactive WebPage for BlackBooks Bookstore

This webpage uses an .xml file to structure the data transformed to HTMLO for client-side consumption.

Retrieval and manipulation of the data shown can be done by use of the modules integrated on the left-hand side of the webpage.
The Bootstrap framework was used to implement the user-interface as well as visual representation done with CSS. A javascript file was also implemented to add interactive features to the application.

Further details of the application can be found at the report submitted through moodle.cct.
