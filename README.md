# Interactive Web Application (BSc in IT - Group B) 2019 â€“ CCT<br/>
Assignment I - Interactive WebPage for BlackBooks Bookstore

This webpage uses a .xml file to structure the data transformed to HTMLO for client-side consumption.

Retrieval and manipulation of the data shown can be done by use of the modules integrated on the left-hand side of the webpage.
The Bootstrap framework was used to implement the user-interface as well as visual representation done with CSS. A javascript file was also implemented to add interactive features to the application.

Further details of the application can be found at the report submitted through moodle.cct.

Most of the code for this application was forked from <a href="https://github.com/mikhail-cct/CA1-In-class-Demo">this page</a> and adapted to match the Bookstore requirements.
